Salary** : My CTC is very low so looking for CTC around 10-12 LPA (this is not possible if I switch roles in the same company)\\n\\n**2.

But in the company being working as a testers\\xA0I always somehow participated in developments tasks, such as developing tools for team to increase productivity, participation in hackathons etc.\\n\\n3. **Why Not tried earlier??**.

{"id": 2121359, "content": "**About Me:**\\nYOE: Almost 2 years Full Time (1 month less), 2 months Internship.\\nEdu: BTech EE from Tier-1 IIT.\\nCurrent Company: Product Based MNC in Fintech. Had 16 Base with 10%  variable on this base, after competing offers they increased base to 20. \\n\\n\\n**Meesho SDE2 Offer:**\\nBase: 34 \\nJoining Bonus: 2 (If you join in less than a month, I was joining in 2 weeks, the give JB only when you join super early and I think they will offer by themself, but you can definitely call out that since you\\'re early you deserve some JB :))\\n\\nESOPs: 25 (Cliff of 1 year with 25% then monthly vesting for next 3 years, total vesting over 4 years).\\n\\n**Amazon SDE1 Offer:**\\nBase: 25 \\nJB: 3 for each of next 2 years.\\nRSUs: 6 RSUs, Standard Amazon Vesting.\\n\\nThinking to go with Meesho and if (Maybe?) I don\\'t like it there try Amazon SDE2. Can someone tell me that if I decline amazon I will be blacklisted or something? As you guys would already know there\\'s a colossal pay gap between SDE1 and SDE2 in Amazon. I haven\\'t told Amazon yet about the competing offer, but even if they match Meesho I still would like to go ahead with Meesho as I feel learning would be better and I could try Amazon SDE2 in a year or so, (if not blacklisted LOL). I am specially confident with Amazon because with personal interview experience in Amazon SDE1 and my network\\'s expereinces I feel the overall bar at Amazon is a joke (ofcourse there is always a chance I will be declined, def possible).\\n\\n**Any Suggestions from you guys are welcome.**\\n\\n**My Research**: Definitely Meesho\\'s arm Farmiso had 150 lay offs but they weren\\'t techs. (Like OYO had quite a few HR layoff and Netflix recently had layoff again non-tech. But I know can\\'t really compare Meesho with these (ik ik ik) ). Also I did competitive programming in college and even find time to do it know, So confident that can find jobs elsewhere if things go south (Again I know everything I plan can go in the ditch, possible, point taken).\\n\\n**What I want currently in my career?** : In my current MNC people are awesome, awesome WLB, but learning is saturated I understand Design patterns and stuff but things are already taken care of. I want to make things myself, thats why I am good with aggressive culture. I am ~24 so not really looking from WLB, When I was preparing for JEE in Kota, life was shit, no doubt, but still looking back I feel those guys made me so much stronger and the habits I formed back then continue to help me till today, I am actually looking to have that environment again, Work hard play hard. Seriously need pointers fellas, Also let me know if you guys need more info and Sorry for long post, Many thanks.\\n\\n**UPDATE**: Just told the Amazon HR that I am taking Meesho will try Amazon SDE2 later if I feel like, she was cool with it, didn\\'t tell me I am blacklisted or anything, Also I must say I had a great experience with Amazon Recruitment all rounds and feedbacks were lightning fast."}

Think of negotitating as another round where you have to use your communication skills to get a good offer, which means you should take some time to prepare for this along with technical and behavioral rounds. Here are some tips to negotiate for a better offer:\\n\\n1. Never accept the inital offer. There is always room for negotiation even if you do not hold any competing offers.\\n2. Be polite to your recruiter, they have to bat for you so that you can get a better offer.\\n2. Do some research on Leetcode to come up with the minimum amount acceptable to you.\\n3. When recruiter asks for expected salary, never mention the number. Always ask for the budget and use this no come up with your compensation. If they press you too much, ask 15% more than your minimum acceptable amount. You can also just tell them to give the best possible offer for the role.\\n4. If you are not happy with the numbers presented, do let them know that you are not happy with the offer and mention your achievements and how you would bring value into the organization to ask for more.\\n"}

Every single question on the onsite was asked to either implement a class which supported some concurrency operation, or write a function where multithreading was necessary.\\n\\nSo, make sure to practice that in the language of your choice. Past that, understand the various threading models, and actually write code (don\\'t just read about them).

I\\'ve not been a conventional Product Manager with the fancy lingo to go along but I\\'ve worked on product most of my working career. \\n\\nWhat could I ask for which gets me something fair. I want to work for MS and I have no competing offers. \\n\\nBase Salary - ? RSU\\'s - ? Bonus - ? What could I expect without being cocky? Is the Level - 63 correct? I kinda see people with much lesser experience than me at 64. \\n\\nMy assumption also is that those that can write code and write it well can expect more. So a Level 64/64 SDE3 may be paid quite a bit more than a PM - or is it fixed as per levels?"}

Gave psuedo solution for O(log n) solution\\n* Log n solution: Computing for n=2^i\\n* For example you can compute for n=1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 etc\\n* To compute for n=2^i you need to have information about n=2^(i-1). You need to have how many possible count of n=2^(i-1) ends with 0,1 and 2 consecutive \\'L\\' start and 0,1 and 2 consecutive \\'L\\' end and also about how many of then have 0 and 1 absentes\\n* So n=2^i can be computed from n=2^(i-1) by using 16 steps((3+3)x2 first 3 comes from  0,1 and 2 consecutive \\'L\\' start next 3 comes from  0,1 and 2 consecutive \\'L\\' end and 2 comes from (0 or 1 absent)) \\n* Finally for n=5, you can use computations done for n=4 and n=1\\n* Similarly for n=10 use computations done for n=8 and n=2. \\n* Thus the main step is combining.\\n\\nRound 2:\\nThe questions asked were\\n1. https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/\\n2.

{"id": 3115180, "content": "What is TypeScript?\\nMicrosoft created and maintains TypeScript, an object-oriented programming language.\\nIt\\'s a syntactical superset of JavaScript with the addition of optional static typing.\\n\\nTypeScript can be used to create JavaScript applications that run on\\nboth the server and the client. The most popular TypeScript programs are also JavaScript\\nprograms.\\n\\nWhat is JavaScript?\\nJavaScript, shortened as JS, is a scripting language that follows the ECMAScript\\nstandard. JavaScript is a just-in-time compiled language with a high level of abstraction\\nand multi-pattern support.\\n\\nJavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with web pages and is\\na necessary component of web applications\\n\\nAlthough JavaScript engines were once only found in web browsers, they are now used\\non a wide range of servers, most notably via Node.js. JavaScript derivatives include\\nTypeScript, CoffeeScript, Dart, and Kotlin\\n\\nWhy Use TypeScript?\\nTypescript is a superset of JavaScript. This means Typescript is a combination of\\nJavaScript and a few more characteristics. Developers will find it easier to work with\\nJavaScript due to the language.\\nHere are some more instances of what TypeScript is used for:\\nImprove IDE Support:\\n\\nTypeScript development is a significant improvement over JavaScript development.\\nAtom, Sublime, Visual Studio Code, and WebStorm are just a few of the JavaScript\\nIDEs that offer excellent support for both TypeScript and JavaScript.\\nInteroperability:\\n\\nTypeScript is strongly linked to JavaScript. As a result, it has high interoperability\\ncapabilities, although it requires some additional work to work with JS libraries in\\nTypeScript.\\nStatic Typing:\\n\\nJavaScript is tightly typed, so it doesn\\'t know what kind of variable it\\'s dealing with\\nuntil it\\'s practically created at runtime. JavaScript now has type support due to\\nTypeScript.\\nStrict Null Examination:\\n\\nIn JavaScript software programming, errors, like cannot to read property \\'x\\' of\\nundefined, are common. Since a variable that is unknown to the TypeScript compiler\\ncannot be used, you can avoid most of these errors.\\nSupports New ECMAScript:\\n-TypeScript can trans-pile unique ECMAScript criteria to ECMAScript objectives of\\nyour choice. As a result, you can use lambda, modules, functions, the spread\\noperator, de-structuring, and classes, which are all features of ES2015 and beyond.\\n\\nType Inference:\\n\\nThe use of type inference in TypeScript makes typing easier and less confusing. Even\\nif you don\\'t use the interface, TypeScript can help you avoid mistakes that could\\ncause runtime issues.\\nWhy Use JavaScript?\\nJavaScript is in high demand these days, as it is supported by the majority of browsers\\nand web-based applications. In addition to the web, it\\'s utilized in servers, applications,\\nand embedded hardware controllers.\\nThe following are some basic reasons why designing a JavaScript application is\\npreferable:\\nFoundational Language :\\n\\nThe event-driven software design style organizes the movement of your code by\\nsystem events or user events, and JavaScript supports it.\\nFun and Interactive Language :\\n\\nYou\\'ll have immediate access to a complete user interface. JavaScript has a\\ngraphical user interface that is both entertaining and simple to use. Early in the\\nlearning process, you can construct browser-based scripts to create interactive\\nprojects.\\nLearning Support :\\n\\nEach browser has to source code viewing features that allow you to learn from the\\nlive coding of others. In addition, JavaScript has the largest and most dynamic\\nlibrary code repository in the ecosystem. Individuals in the JavaScript community\\nare extremely helpful and active in sharing and repurposing one another\\'s code.\\nLow Requirements to Start :\\n\\nBrowsers use a programming language called JavaScript. It\\'s a lot simpler to\\nunderstand, and you can get started right away. Unlike other languages, JavaScript\\ndoes not require you to install a large number of programs before you can begin\\nusing it.\\nRich Interfaces :\\n\\nTo provide a rich interface to your website users, you can use JavaScript to include\\nfeatures like sliders and drag-and-drop components.\\nSuperior Debugging Tools :\\n\\nThe web browser has a collaborative JavaScript interpreter that allows you to\\nexplore and receive immediate feedback, allowing you to learn more quickly.\\n** Conclusion:\\n\\nAfter reviewing all of the information presented in this article, we can conclude that both\\nlanguages have advantages and disadvantages.\\n\\nTypeScript is designed for developers who desire to write understandable, well-\\norganized code. We\\'re not even going to mention what TypeScript has to provide, such as\\nlive-bug checking and static typing.\\n\\nAlthough JavaScript is not a complete programming language, it can be used in\\ncombination with HTML to improve web page quality. You\\'ll also find a lot of seasoned\\nengineers who know how to code in JavaScript."}

{"id": 3285600, "content": "Hi Everyone,\\n\\nLots of candidates are fascicated towards Browserstack Compensation and Permanent WFH Policy But they should know some real insight of the company.\\n\\nMy intention is not to disparage Browserstack, but rather to provide an accurate portrayal of the company and its employees.\\n\\nLet\\'s see some Pros \\u2705\\n\\nNo Doubt, All the members of software developers are amazing and really helpful.\\nIn your role, you\\'ll be exposed to a diverse range of technologies and various programming languages, which will provide you with a valuable opportunity to expand your skillset.\\nWorking with Browserstack will provide you with a valuable opportunity to gain experience in managing a startup, leading teams, and overseeing the software development processes.\\nLet\\'s see cons \\uD83D\\uDE08\\n\\nYou are going to forget about what\\'s a good work life balance because there no such concept in reality but surely a good WLB is present only on papers or offer Letters.\\nThey will treat you like a nothing. you are only resources for them. They will going to utilise you until you are going to say - \"there\\'s too much of Task in the plate\"\\nThe company often uses the term \"responsibility\" as an excuse to assign multiple tasks with tight deadlines. Even if you work hard from morning till late at night, there\\'s always a possibility of some tasks being left unfinished. In such cases, the company will view you as an irresponsible person, regardless of the effort you put in.\\nThe company did not explicitly declare that they were laying off employees. Instead, they are using a program called \"PEP\" (Performance Enhancement Plan) to justify the termination of many software developers who have received low performance ratings.\\nThe most concerning aspect of their system is that they did not offer any severance package to the affected employees. Furthermore, they even took back the work-from-home reimbursement amount from some employees, and if an employee mistakenly asked for the money back, the company ignored their requests and stopped communicating with them altogether. It appears that the company does not value these employees anymore.\\nThere Feedback system is worst than you think. you will Laugh at some point is this Really a point to discuss. In short if they decided to give you a poor Rating then No body can stop them\\nThe company\\'s main focus seems to be taking advantage of the fact that their employees are working from home permanently. According to them, since employees are at home, they have no other distractions or commitments, so they try to push for maximum output under the mask of responsibility and quarterly ratings.\\nThe company does not believe in rewarding or showing appreciation for minor accomplishments or tasks, unless you have created an extraordinary system or exceeded their expectations in some way.\\nThe ideology they used was Use and Throw\\n\\nThere\\'s no need to be afraid of the current market situation. While it\\'s true that there\\'s a recession happening, it\\'s also a fact that there are many job openings available. Preparing for interviews is a very different game than working for an organization. Those who have appeared for interviews must be knowing about it. Believe me, if you start interviewing for multiple job openings, you will gain a lot of valuable experience throughout the process. Have confidence in yourself, even in the current situation, and you will surely find a job placement soon.\\n\\nThis whole experience was so bad for me and lots of my friends and I wanted to share this with the community so that they decide well before joining any company.\\nThank you for reading this long piece of text."}

The company culture is also very welcoming and inclusive, with frequent team-building events and opportunities for collaboration.\\n\\nHowever, I have noticed that there are some issues with work-life balance at the company. There have been times when I have been asked to work long hours and in night without adequate compensation or recognition. This has led to some burnout and stress among employees.\\n\\nAdditionally, there could be more growth opportunities and policies in place to support employees\\' professional development. While there are some training programs available, they are not always well-organized or tailored to individual needs.\\n\\nThis created a stressful and unsustainable work environment, which ultimately led to high levels of employee burnout and turnover.\\n\\nThere have been some concerns raised about micromanagement by certain managers. This can be frustrating and demotivating for employees who would like more autonomy in their work.\\n\\nOverall, while there were some positive aspects to working at FOX, the company\\'s work-life balance, growth opportunities, and micromanagement policies were significant areas of concern. I would recommend that the company take a more proactive approach to address these issues to better support their employees and improve the overall work environment.\\n\\nWork Culture: Deeply nested and hierarchical its very hard to get things resolved even it takes months to get things sorted out with so much struggle due to hierarchy this makes it very toxic. \\nupper management entertains mental harassment in india.\\n\\n**Company repo**: Good < Media Company in the US >\\n**Work-life balance**: poor\\n**Micro-Manage**: pervasive culture of favoritism and nepotism\\n**Salary**: on time\\n**Structure**: Very much Hierarchical.\\n**Benefits**: Maximum of benefits are only for us people like discounts on purchases, food, coupons, etc. India team gets home setup only.\\n\\n**What kind of Projects are there :**\\nFE is Mostly its CMS written on react \\nBE its python, java, and mix of AWS services.\\nQA: Manual, automation\\n\\nThe company also had a poor workplace culture, with rampant favoritism.

{"id": 3368071, "content": "\\nI received this problem on-site at Atlassian for an SWE  intern position. We spent about half an hour on this problem.\\n\\nI want to contribute this question because there are multiple solutions using different techniques (i.e. dsu, math) that perform better than the brute force solution. I think this question would be a LeetCode Medium.\\nDescription\\nGiven an array A of size n, where A[i] denotes the student number (A[i]=i, for all 1<=i<=n). Given another array B of size n such that i\\xAD\\xAD\\xAD\\xADth student of array A is the friend of the ith student of array B ( i.e, A[i] and B[i] are friends) and a student can ask doubt his friend. You have to tell that is the doubt of student \\u2018K\\u2019 will be solved in less than T minutes or not? (If a student \\u2018X\\u2019 asks doubt to student \\u2018Y\\u2019, it takes one minute time and if student \\u2018Y\\u2019 don\\u2019t know the answer, he can ask his friend.\\n\\nIf any student asks the doubt to himself, then he got the answer in just one minute. \\n\\n<u>Note</u>\\n\\nNote that Time will be consumed only in asking the doubt, not in answering.\\n \\n\\nExample:\\n\\nGiven n=7,A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], B=[5,1,1,3,7,5,7,7],K=4 and T=6\\nOutput will be 1.\\n\\n \\n\\n<u>Explanation </u>\\n\\nGiven array A is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\\n\\nGiven array B is 5 1 1 3 7 5 7 7\\n\\n          K=4 and T=6\\n\\nNow,\\n\\nAt T= 0, student 4 will ask doubt to student 3 because 3 is the friend of 4.\\n\\nAt T= 1, student 3 will ask doubt to student 1 because 1 is the friend of 3.\\n\\nAt T= 2, student 1 will ask doubt to student 5 because 5 is the friend of 1.\\n\\nAt T= 4, student 5 will ask doubt to student 7 because 7 is the friend of 5.\\n\\nAt T= 5, student 7 will ask doubt to student 7 because 7 is the friend of 7 and as student 7 is friend of itself he gets the answer and pas back to student K(4) through the friends of friend.\\n\\n \\n\\nSo, the student K will get his answer within T(6) minutes because he takes only 5 minutes to solve his doubt.\\n\\nHence, result will be 1.\\n\\nSolutions\\n\\tUse the concept of disjoint set and try to find a student who is friend of itself.\\n\\tIf you get such student within T minutes, return 1, otherwise return -1.   \\n\\n#include <iostream>\\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>  \\nusing namespace std; \\nbool find(int K,int B[],int cnt,int T)\\n{ \\n    if(K == B[K])\\n    { \\n      \\tif(cnt<T)\\n      \\treturn true;\\n      \\telse\\n      \\treturn false;\\n\\t}\\n    if(cnt>=T)\\n    return false;\\n    \\n    return find(B[K],B,cnt+1,T);\\n}\\nint doubtSolver(int n,int A[],int B[],int K,int T)\\n{  \\n\\tbool res=find(K,B,1,T);\\n\\tif(res==true)\\n\\treturn 1;\\n\\telse\\n\\treturn -1;\\n}\\n \\nint main()\\n{  \\n  \\n  int n;\\n  cin>>n;\\n  int A[n+1],B[n+1];\\n  for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)\\n  cin>>A[i];\\n  for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)\\n  cin>>B[i];\\n  int K,T;\\n  cin>>K>>T; \\n  int res=doubtSolver(n,A,B,K,T);\\n  cout<<res;\\n  return 0;\\n}\\n\\nTest Cases\\nInput:  n=7,A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], B=[5,1,1,3,7,5,7,7],K=4 and T=6\\nOutput: 1\\n\\nInput:  n=6,A = [1,2,4,3,5,6], B=[1,3,2,1,5,6],K=3 and T=2\\nOutput: -1"}

So when I started searching for jobs related to Data science there were hardly jobs for freshers either they requires 3+ yoe or Masters. And there were many jobs related to Frontend/Backend even for fresher. So I am willing to learn any tech, I asked my manager if he is okay to to put me in Frontend/Backend team also he is fine with it to put me in any Project. The project in which I am working right now is best in TCS also team & manager is also best.\\n\\nSo I am confused what should I do whether change the project to Frontend/Backend  for quick switch or stay in Data science for better future.\\n\\nAny comments/feedback will be appreciated"}

Your reason may be different, but you **should** write in resume about **any** your good qualities. Good luck with finding a job"}

{"id": 3593182, "content": "Was thinking long and hard about this and couldnt come up with a counterexample, so posting this here. \\n\\n* Indian Startups are NOT doing anything INNOVATIVE. It the same thing that most of them are doing just packaging them in different containers. Lets take the example of some of the biggest startups in India Swiggy, Zomato, BigBasket, Flipkart, Myntra etc(i know some are bigger than startups and some have been acquired), they all are doing the same thing. Some of them are selling clothes, some grocery, some appliances, some food. Each year a new startup comes that promises to deliver grocery in 5 mins less than the competitor. IMO all these startups are bound to fail at some point. Lets take the case study of Swiggy, Zomato. They both are eating from the same pie and the pie aint getting any larger. Its not like you will start consuming breakfast twice because of these companies. so as more companies start adding to this pie, the profit of Swiggy, Zomato will decrease(its bound to happen). What can be done? Open their business in new cities? Oh but hardly the restarurant infrastructure is there in smaller cities. So they need to diversify their business at some point to selling something other than food.\\n* Most of the engineers working in these companies are also doing the same thing, maintaining Kafka queues, wriitng springboot to create a microservice that fetches some things from some queue and process it, or look at the data spit out of these services etc. The only new thing that they have to encounter is during these Big Billion Sales, where need to do the usual things at scale. But other than that what are they learning?\\n\\nPlease post your opinions. Would really love to hear everyones thoughts on this. Hope I am wrong."}

I was offered the Intern role based on my performance in the Global Alpha Researcher(GAR) Role. The Internship role and the GAR role are very similar wrt to the the work/projects assigned and also compensation wise. I have even seen my fellow GARs make more than the above mentioned stipend, since there is a huge performance based component. The major difference is that the GAR role is remote and one can work from anywhere, whereas for the Internship we need to be present in the firm\\'s Office in Cybercity Gurugram.\\n\\n**Reasons for Accepting the Offer** : \\n1. As GARs we get complete ownership of the work we do, and firm recogonises the efforts and rewards the top performers with monetary awards regularly. \\n\\n2. The mentorship and feedback provided by the senior management is a big upside of working here. The upper management(even the CEO) is very easily approachable to discuss innovative ideas and trade them in live markets. \\n\\n3. The stipend I feel is at par with the top HFTs and is more than what peers like Worldquant offer to Summer Interns."}

He asked REST API, and MVC how rest API sends the request to the server. He asked me to code some functionalities that I have made in my internship and projects. He asked about dockers and Jenkins as I have worked on them as one of my interns. So basically he asked each and every word mentioned on my resume.\\nSo the result came around 17 people cleared 1st round and I was one of them.\\n\\nRound 2->\\nSo In this round as well projects-related stuff was asked and internship-related stuff. But he focussed more on databases and routes. he asked about MongoDB schema, queries, oops-related concepts, DBMS, and a bit of os thread-related stuff. he asked me to code some javascript functionalities that I have made in one of my intern on paper. then he started asking about DBMS theory and SQL queries were also asked. Overall the round went well. I was able to answer almost everything. So the result came for me in 15 minutes. Round 2 and Round 3 were going on parallelly from here on. So I got selected for 3rd round\\n\\nRound3->\\nIt was hr round he asked general questions from me. Easy puzzles were also asked in this round. General discussion about my future goals.
